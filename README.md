# pyopenkeyval

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyopenkeyval.png)](http://badge.fury.io/py/pyopenkeyval)

[OpenKeyval.org](http://openkeyval.org/) is a service for easily storing and
retrieving key/value pairs via HTTP. *pyopenkeyval* is a Python interface to
this service, presented as a dict-like object that accesses data on OpenKeyval.

## Installing

    $ sudo python setup.py install

## Examples

### Normal usage

    from pyopenkeyval import pyopenkeyval
    okv = pyopenkeyval()
    okv['example'] = 'Hello, online key/value storage!'
    print okv['example']

If you need the result from storing a value, use the `store()` method instead:

    result = okv.store('example', 'Hello, online key/value storage!')
    print result['read_only_key']

To check if a key has a value, use the `in` keyword. Note that this will also
cache the value if caching is activated.

    if 'example' in okv:
         ...

### Deleting keys

To delete a key, either set its value to '' or use the `del` keyword:

    del okv['example']

### Caching

If you want to cache retrieved values locally, set the `cache_time` argument
when constructing the `pyopenkeyval` object. This specifies the number of
seconds to cache individual values.

    okv = pyopenkeyval(cache_time=60)

To clear the cache completely at any time, call the `clear_cache()` method.

### SSL support

OpenKeyval.org also supports SSL over HTTPS for more secure transfer of data.
To use SSL, set the `ssl` argument to True.

    okv = pyopenkeyval(ssl=True)

Note that the HTTP och HTTPS versions of OpenKeyval.org are completely
separate. Values set in one can't be fetched from the other.

## Python 3

*pyopenkeyval* is since version 0.3 compatible with Python 3. It must, however,
either be installed using `setup.py` (as described above) before use, or
manually be converted using the `2to3` tool.

Also note that values fetched will be returned as `bytes`. To use these as
strings, call the `.decode()` method on them first. When setting values, either
`str` or `bytes` can be used.

## Requirements

Python 2.5 and lower require *simplejson* to be installed.
